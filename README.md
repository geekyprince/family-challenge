# Problem Statement

Our coding challenges are set in the planet of Lengaburu. King Shan is the emperor and has been ruling for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu you see)!

In this problem you have to write code to model out the Shan family tree so that when given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’ as an input, the output are the people that correspond to the relationship. See more details on the family tree.

Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console. Your program should execute and take the location to the test file as parameter.
