# Problem Statement

Our coding challenges are set in the planet of Lengaburu. King Shan is the emperor and has been ruling for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu you see)!

In this problem you have to write code to model out the Shan family tree so that when given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’ as an input, the output are the people that correspond to the relationship. See more details on the family tree.

Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console. Your program should execute and take the location to the test file as parameter.

# Requirements

<li>Python 3.7 or above</li>

# Usage

The Family Hierarchy data is present in the FamilyData.txt

There are no hardcoded values inside the program :)

1)Child can be added through mother already in the family.
2)Name of relatives can be retrived by provide name of person and relationship to retrieve

<ul>
<li>
Method 1:
<ul>
<li>This method is used when the input file is in someother location</li>
<li>The output of the program is only displayed in the console</li>
<li>This method does not invoke the IntegrationTest of the module</li>
</ul>
<br>
Change Directory into the root directory (Where the geektrust.py is)<br>
Type the following command to run the module

```python
python -m geektrust /absolutepath_to_input_file
```

To run the tests that are provided in the repo
```python
python -m unittest
```
To run the Integration Test (First run the program and then run this)
```python
python -m unittest current_folder/tests/IntegrationTest.py
```
</li>
<li>
Method 2:
<ul>
<li>This method is used when you need to add new inputs and outputs in the tests folder</li>
<li>Add the input file to the inputs folder and make sure they follow the same style as the other files</li>
<li>Add the output file to the outputs folder</li>
<li>The output generated by the program will be visible both in the console and in the files</li>
<li>The files are then used by the IntegrationTest.py to check if there are any differences
in the expected output and actual output</li>
</ul>
<br>
cd into the root directory (Where Runner.sh is)<br>
This Script clears the current terminal screen and then shows the output

```bash
chmod +x Runner.sh 
./Runner.sh
```
</li>
</ul>
